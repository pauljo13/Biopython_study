# Introduction to Python
Python : created by in the early 1990s Guido van Rossum in Amsterdam.
    "A high-level scripting language that allows for interactivity"

Python is an interpreted language that can be run both in script of in interactive mode.

### Features od Python
- Concise an clear syntax
- Code indentation
- Set of high-level and powerful data types
- Simple, but effective, approach to object-oriented programming
- Modularity

### Data types in Python
| Data type   | Complexity | Order | Mutable | Indexed | Heterogeneous |
|-------------|------------|-------|---------|---------|---------------|
| int         | primitive  | -     | yes     | -       | -             |
| float       | primitive  | -     | yes     | -       | -             |
| complex     | primitive  | -     | yes     | -       | -             |
| Boolean     | primitive  | -     | yes     | -       | -             |
| string      | container  | yes   | no      | yes     | no            |
| list        | container  | yes   | yes     | yes     | yes           |
| tuple       | container  | yes   | no      | yes     | yes           |
| set         | container  | no    | yes     | no      | yes           |
| dictionary  | container  | no    | yes     | no      | yes           |


### Mathematical and Character Functions

- **abs(x)**: absolute value of `x`
- **round(x, n)**: `x` rounded to a precision of `n` places
- **pow(x, y)**: `x` raised to power of `y`
- **ord(c)**: ASCII numerical code for character `c`
- **chr(x)**: ASCII string (with a single character) for numerical code `x`


### Assigning values to variables
Operator "=" is used to assign a value to a variable name.

### Testing two variables equality
== : for a comparison between two variables, testing their equality

Result : Boolean type

### String
String are sequences of characters, which can be defined by text enclosed by the characters "" or ''


### Formatting
- %s = string or anything
- %d = integer
- %f = floating=point
- %% = literal '%'
